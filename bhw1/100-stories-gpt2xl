Once upon a time, you had to go to some big box store with a computer to buy one of these old computers. Today, there's an app for that! This machine features a 32-bit ARM11 processor, 1 GB of RAM, 2 GB of storage, an Ethernet connector, 802.11b/g/n WiFi, microSD card slot, headphone and microphone ports, and even an analog video output port. Not bad for a box that costs about $100. Or so it seems. It's really nice, but it's hardly a pocket-portable game machine. In fact, it's pretty darn large. If you're a big nerd, take note: this machine is a big nerd's game machine! You probably noticed that we haven't even mentioned the price. That's because, well, you know.
Consistency: 6 - The story jumps between discussing the features of a computer and its size, without a clear connection between the two. It also mentions the price but doesn't explain why it's not mentioned. Overall, the story lacks consistency.
Fluency: 7 - The sentences are coherent and the story is easy to follow, but the transitions between different topics could be smoother.

Once upon a time, there were two women. One was very nice, the other was not so nice. And that is the story of the most beautiful and the least beautiful. I will not say which was the more beautiful, for it is the one I rather long to know." This is another one of the most beautiful and interesting pieces of writing that a man has ever written. It starts very small, and then proceeds to show you more and more. There are very few things that I have ever read which have had the power to change my life with how I look at myself. This is one of those things, and I don't hesitate to say it is the best piece of writing I have ever read. At the same time it is the least important thing the author has ever written. This is quite the accomplishment, and not at all to be taken lightly. "For years I had wondered who the woman was I had left her for.
Consistency: 5 - The story starts with two women and their beauty, but then abruptly switches to discussing the impact of a piece of writing on the author's life. There is no clear connection between the two parts. The story lacks consistency.
Fluency: 6 - The sentences are somewhat disjointed and the transitions between ideas are not smooth, making it difficult to follow the story.

Once upon a time (this is a long time ago, as I've recently gone through a major midlife crisis,) I had the bright idea of looking into what I'd lost for no reason. The first thing I found was a little pamphlet on the inside of my suitcase. I didn't want to open it, but I had to. It was written in Spanish, and it was clear that if I had just opened his suitcase I would have been able find the item he'd left inside, but if I hadn't opened it, I would have found it after all of this time! I know that my daughter, Liza, would be thrilled if she could find the pink bow of her dress! To translate – "In addition to the usual things we can't live without because that would be wasteful, we also have a lot of things in our head. It's much more difficult to find the things we've lost in our head." The same was true of my suitcase.
Consistency: 7 - The story revolves around the theme of lost items and the difficulty of finding them. However, the mention of a midlife crisis and a daughter's pink bow dress feels out of place and doesn't contribute to the overall consistency of the story.
Fluency: 7 - The sentences flow reasonably well, but the inclusion of unrelated details interrupts the story's fluency.

Once upon a time, the best part of playing "Havoc" was getting to play with those awesome toys I got after winning a tournament. (If you missed the first one, this one was from Gen Con 2012, so it's almost a decade old.) However, now, I rarely talk to my opponents or go to the store or anything because in the tournament scene, we spend all our time together. With a lot less time for real stuffs to do, things tend to get bad, I feel. At the same time, I've always liked to be with my friends. I enjoy the social aspect of the game and I think I've had a great time in tournament play with the guys I am close with, but when you have to play a real tournament every week, then you start to wonder what your lives are like.
Consistency: 6 - The story begins with playing a game and receiving toys as rewards, but then shifts to discussing the lack of social interaction and the impact on the author's life. The connection between the two parts is not clear. The story lacks consistency.
Fluency: 7 - The sentences are coherent, but the transitions between ideas could be smoother, making the story slightly less fluent.

Once upon a time, it was called the "U.S." Then, over thirty years ago, it was called the Canadian dollar. The reason? The Canadian dollar had less value than the U.S. dollar. Now we have the dollar's first official exchange rate: the U.S. dollar to Euro. This was adopted by the U.S. Mint in 1967, but has only now been adopted in its current form by the European Central Bank. There are, needless to say, all sorts of problems associated with these exchange rates; as such, they may be used under the most extreme of circumstances, but they are only a minor part of the dollar's currency history.
Consistency: 7 - The story discusses the change in currency terminology and the adoption of exchange rates, which maintains a consistent theme. However, the mention of problems associated with exchange rates feels disconnected and doesn't contribute significantly to the overall consistency.
Fluency: 7 - The sentences are coherent, but the transitions between ideas could be smoother to improve the overall fluency of the story.

Once upon a time, I read a book in French. It was "La Vie en Rose" by Jeanne D'Arc. It was a beautiful book, in French. I learned one phrase and later, found another in the book, and then another, and after about twenty-five minutes, I knew the whole thing. So do you if you write books in French. If you do know their names, read them aloud until your mind can picture their words as vividly as you can the words in another language, and then sing a dozen French words at once. And you say each word in French, but don't use any of the syllables, because they sound ridiculous. In my own language, as I'm beginning to learn, I don't care what the books say. That is why I never want to study French, because I haven't learned anything in my language that a book cannot teach me.
Consistency: 6 - The story starts with the author reading a book in French and learning phrases from it, but then transitions to discussing the author's lack of interest in studying French. The connection between the two parts is not clear, leading to a lack of consistency.
Fluency: 6 - The sentences are somewhat disjointed and the transitions between ideas are not smooth, making it difficult to follow the story.

Once upon a time, "a young man got up every morning, went to class, was an enthusiastic contributor to the class and left a great deal of his worldly goods behind." Now that he's reached retirement, though, the same man "has no worldly means: he owns no land, no real estate, no business, no stock, no bonds. And he has no real interest in politics." You've got to wonder what that would be like.
Consistency: 5 - The story begins with a description of a young man's daily routine, but then abruptly shifts to discussing his lack of worldly possessions and interest in politics. The connection between the two parts is not clear, resulting in a lack of consistency.
Fluency: 5 - The sentences are disjointed and the transitions between ideas are not smooth, making the story less fluent and difficult to follow.

Once upon a time there was Aiden McGrew… Aiden McGrew was a big name athlete in the late 60s who had a really great career in college. I loved watching him play, and the Eagles chose him #3 overall in the 1977 NFL Draft to be the Eagles QB at the time (the Eagles would trade for Joe Namath, a top five pick in the 1978 Draft, that year). He played 4 years and started 3 of them. During the Eagles last season, my friend, fellow Philly Eagles superfan Joe Shulman, spent a lot of time with Aiden. He told me about Aiden's time at the University of Pennsylvania: Aiden started his college career off with a bang. He had taken a freshman starting QB job in the 1st game of the year, and he almost led the team to a win.
Consistency: 7 - The story revolves around the career of Aiden McGrew, discussing his college and professional football journey. The consistent theme of his football career is maintained throughout the story.
Fluency: 7 - The sentences flow reasonably well, but there are moments where the transitions between ideas could be smoother, slightly impacting the fluency of the story.

Once upon a time, before the Internet was everywhere, I lived in the small eastern Montana town of Whitefish, a good part of my extended family just stopped coming when I hit 30, which is about my age, so every year I would just have to go look out my window and see where people were instead of having them all around me doing their little things. I used to watch people come around to me, they'd come up to me and start telling me shit about politics (I'm not a total conservative, but my family is), how they were going to write me off of their list of friends if I didn't let them write me off of theirs. I have a few thousand friends and I can't count how many times I've listened to people talking about how hard being conservative in Montana is, even though that's hardly what people do here all the time.
Consistency: 5 - The story jumps between discussing the author's family, their political views, and the difficulty of being conservative in Montana. There is no clear connection between the different topics, resulting in a lack of consistency.
Fluency: 5 - The sentences are disjointed, and the transitions between ideas are not smooth, making it difficult to follow the story.

Once upon a time there was an ancient city named Diceto. In the city were three sisters - three sisters who had been abandoned by their mother for being of a higher birth class. All three of them were sent to a boarding school. Upon graduation from the school they were taken to their first destination - an island that was known previously as Lomir. At some stage in their lives they developed a relationship - as it seemed to be their unique talents. One said that the best thing about him was that he had a gift in music and wrote a great number of pieces of music and songs that were performed around the island. The other said that he was kind and handsome and also had a great musical talent. One day the sisters were walking in the fields when the two of them began playing together and were making music with their tongues. The sisters asked for a little bit more, for they loved their brother dearly and felt the music was something that their brothers played.
Consistency: 7 - The story revolves around three sisters with unique talents, their relationship with each other, and their musical abilities. The consistent theme of music is maintained throughout the story.
Fluency: 6 - The sentences flow reasonably well, but there are moments where the transitions between ideas could be smoother, slightly impacting the fluency of the story.

Once upon a time, when you started writing a novel, you used to sit in a room and start writing, then you'd go home, then you'd come back and finish, and then another two weeks went by and then four, then eight. Then you had a rough draft. The more time you spent in that room, the more vivid the story would be. But now you can take some time to rest, too. You can put in longer evenings at the computer, or just give your novel a rest, say, for an entire five days, or maybe even longer, and then it will come out beautifully. It's like watching two films simultaneously: one takes place inside a studio, the other on location. It's true that the writer can start writing one night and finish it the next, but I like to write every day.
Consistency: 6 - The story discusses the process of writing a novel, the importance of taking breaks, and the analogy of watching two films simultaneously. While there is a thread connecting these ideas, the connection between them is not always clear, resulting in a somewhat inconsistent story.
Fluency: 7 - The sentences are coherent, but the transitions between ideas could be smoother, making the story slightly less fluent.

Once upon a time, I was married. But I was divorced with children, so that was that It is an odd thing. I never want to be married again—not by someone new, so I don't know what to do. I have an ideal of what what a marriage should be like…But it doesn't work... I'm married to my dream of becoming an actor. I live my dream with each and every day of my life, but I'm not happy. Maybe I should just have a divorce. There have been rumors of that for a while, but I said no. It's not about me anymore, and I don't see the point in fighting against what I had always been. It's a huge waste of time for everyone concerned...I don't understand…I guess I am just not feeling it anymore. I don't know... You are not allowed to feel sad about things.
Consistency: 7 - The story revolves around the author's view on marriage, their dream of becoming an actor, and their emotions surrounding these topics. The consistent theme of marriage and personal fulfillment is maintained throughout the story.
Fluency: 6 - The sentences are somewhat disjointed, and the transitions between ideas are not smooth, making it difficult to follow the story.

Once upon a time, the US and France waged a war on terror, bombing the Taliban in 2001; Saddam Hussein in 2003; and many of the other suspects in this list. Yet, we all know and understand about how the drone war has created more terrorists. From Pakistan, a group of militants have just killed 100 Americans. Yet, when the war ends, the US will be left with the same number of terrorists as in 2010. Now more than ever the US and its allies are doing everything possible to keep us from getting a thorough understand about the root causes of terrorism. And now, it appears that there is something we can do to reverse the trend and to end it. I'm calling for a major debate in the world's political arenas.
Consistency: 7 - The story discusses various events related to the war on terror, but the transition from discussing the drone war and its consequences to calling for a debate feels a bit abrupt.
Fluency: 7 - The story has some disjointed sentences and lacks smooth transitions between ideas.

Once upon a time, I had been studying the art of a magician called "Shibari" from an old book called "Judo Shishi" (a collection of Japanese martial arts). "Shibari" was a martial art where one held out a hand on the ground with the opponent's hand above it, and you kicked the opponent in the face with that first hand. I was also an expert of "Judo Shishi" and this was my weapon: a "Wakizashi" (which is also called a "Naginata" or "Katana"). After I'd been training for such a long time, I felt like I had some "Shibari" left in me.  And so, the "Kekkei Genkai" (literally, "Demon Blood", in reference to one's demonic side) began.  But now, the true "Shibari" that had been missing had awakened again.
Consistency: 3 - The story jumps between different themes and concepts, including martial arts, weapons, and demonic awakenings, without establishing a clear narrative coherence.
Fluency: 4 - The story is fragmented with confusing and disconnected sentences, making it difficult to follow.

Once upon a time, we used the "L" word. But today, this word is still out of style in most contexts: We can still hear people use the term "L'Écran." However, it is increasingly less common: Today "L'Écran" is a rare term. I know of no useable examples of it. Does it sound like a French word?  Yes, it's French. However, it does not sound like a French word. In modern French, it is more or less a generic term for anything with large letters, for everything that the French call écran.
Consistency: 6 - The story explores the usage and decline of the term "L'Écran," but the relevance and connection between the French word and its meaning are not clearly established.
Fluency: 7 - The story has a coherent structure, but some sentences are awkward and convoluted, hampering the overall fluency.

Once upon a time there was a little girl, a very little girl – She played at things she shouldn't play at. In my time, She lived her days as a little bird at the gazee. It was her bird that sang her day away It was her bird that sang her day away. The bird, now she's a very big bird. She lives in the sky with her big sister (big sister.) She sings her day away up in the sky She sings her day away up in the sky  A bird sings with its song, The child knows To sing is to fly. A bird sings with its song, The child knows To fly is to sing.
Consistency: 3 - The story moves from discussing a little girl to a bird and their connection, but the relationship between these elements is unclear, leaving the story lacking a consistent narrative.
Fluency: 5 - The story has a repetitive structure, but some sentences are fragmented and do not flow smoothly, affecting its overall fluency.

Once upon a time, there was a place in Canada. This is where The B-Team and Star Wars live in their prime and are celebrated in more ways with every passing day, but it is a place that many have forgotten about. That place, if you can believe it, is the city of Toronto. A city that just so happens to hold some pretty important and well known franchises that are often times misunderstood as Canada is Toronto. It would be an understatement to say that the city of Toronto holds a lot of special places in it's pockets and is often times overlooked when its in the spotlight. However, there is one place that can be described as the real Canadian mecca of pop culture. That place is the City of Toronto. To be clear, the city of Toronto does not hold any sort of cultural monopoly in Canada.
Consistency: 6 - The story starts by emphasizing the importance of Toronto in pop culture, but then contradicts itself by stating that Toronto does not hold a cultural monopoly in Canada. This inconsistency lowers the overall consistency rating.
Fluency: 7 - The sentences are generally cohesive, but there are some awkward phrasings and repetitions that affect the fluency.

Once upon a time, I went with my dad to the mall because he knew a discount store down there that was only open on Fridays, but he got lost, and I eventually ended up leaving. But I remember the excitement. It wasn't the lack of shopping that was depressing me — although I didn't have the money to splurge on fancy shoes or a new phone — it was the excitement of seeing other people at the mall. The way they moved their bodies, dressed in their best clothes, and walked around as though they were in a different world. All the things I felt had been done to me because I wasn't black or Latin. That was exciting, and I felt so liberated.
Consistency: 8 - The story maintains a consistent theme of the narrator's excitement and liberation at being in a mall and observing others. There are no evident inconsistencies.
Fluency: 7 - The sentences flow reasonably well, although there are a few instances where the phrasing could be improved for better fluency.

Once upon a time, a certain team came together and tried to make it happen in the same fashion. And even though the team failed (one of these days I will find it), the idea never died.  And today, after seeing the first two trailers from Alien: Covenant, I'm excited to show you all what this team did back in the day.  The concept  All credit for the idea and concept go to Kenji Saito.  In 1977, director Sergio Leone created a short for Japanese television called "Dawn of the Dead." The concept here was for people who die in the apocalypse to be resurrected as zombies. Leone's idea of a zombie apocalypse and the zombies he created have been parodied and copied in countless movies, television shows, comics, anime and video games.  Kenji Saito's team took their zombie concept from Leone and tweaked it slightly.
Consistency: 7 - The story introduces the concept of a team working on a zombie idea but then shifts to discussing director Sergio Leone's work and its influence. This transition makes the story feel slightly disconnected, reducing the consistency.
Fluency: 8 - The sentences flow smoothly, with only a few minor instances where the phrasing could be improved for better fluency.

Once upon a time, a man (or woman) would have a wife so they would not have any children of their own to raise. What they could do was just have sex with women and then pretend to be the woman. Men would put away their clothes at night, get their wives to put their clothes away, then they could hide their wives in their rooms. But then, something happened. Many men found out about the wives. Now they came home to all this nudity and were wondering if they'd be able to get away with it and not get discovered. A solution came to them; pretend that the woman was an older female relative—your Aunt or Cousin. The wives were now considered to have much greater status in the family and could, therefore, have much more freedom. Many men learned the tricks and went along for the ride.
Consistency: 4 - The story starts with a premise about men pretending their wives are older female relatives, but then meanders into a discussion about the wives' increased status and freedom. This inconsistency makes the storyline confusing and lacks coherence.
Fluency: 6 - The sentences are often choppy and disorganized, leading to a lack of fluency in the narrative.

Once upon a time, the idea of keeping track of an artist's back catalog on Spotify was considered just too far-fetched: what's the point, right? We had artists with back catalogs that were three or four years old. We had albums that weren't out for another few months as well. Then, over time, we began to see the growth of our catalog as more and more artists were added to our platform. While the "old school" Spotify was definitely a more challenging endeavor, one which required a considerable amount of research to keep up with what the artists were currently putting out, it proved to have its benefits. As we expanded from an artist-centric streamer (that is, one that only listed their back catalogs) to a full-on streaming platform with millions of streams, it became increasingly important for us that the catalogue grow and thrive.
Consistency: 7 - The story discusses the evolution of Spotify's catalog and the transition from an artist-centric platform to a full-on streaming platform. However, it does not fully explain how this growth and expansion benefitted the platform.
Fluency: 8 - The story is well-written with coherent sentences and a logical flow of ideas.

Once upon a time, the nation that invented this system had a very different relationship with women, and this reality is, in part, what led to the current debate around abortion legislation in the United States. Although the practice was generally illegal, in the late 1700s and early 1800s, this nation of Americans practiced a form of partial birth abortion, or dilation and evacuation, as it was known. For the most part, these women would be forced to continue with a pregnancy, and then have a surgical abortion at the nearest public hospital, whether that hospital were a doctor's office or a public street corner. If a surgical abortion was attempted, several different techniques were used. Many of them relied on dilation and evacuation, which is often associated with the term abortion. Others did not involve surgical intervention at all. In fact, a mother's body will expel the fetus if a surgical procedure is not performed. In other cases, the fetus would be expelled through the vagina.
Consistency: 6 - The story connects the nation's historical relationship with women to the current debate around abortion legislation in the United States. However, it lacks a clear explanation of how these historical practices relate to the current debate.
Fluency: 7 - The story has some disjointed sentences and abrupt transitions between ideas, but overall, it flows adequately.

Once upon a time, we were at war with each other. Now it's a contest for the control of America. And the Democrats lost. And now they're trying to run for president on an Obama-Clinton model. This is the party that thinks that because it's now a minority they can get whatever they want. They're the party that looks on the road to a third Obama term and thinks, "Why can't we do this? Why can't we have it all?" And they just can't go to their base and say, "It's time to stop. It's time to rebuild America. It's time to make the world great again." That just won't do." So what can the Bernie Sanders movement do to reverse the damage the Democratic Party did? Not much, it seems to me. This is still a party that has no intention of changing any of its policies.
Consistency: 4 - The story jumps between discussing the Democrats losing and their policies without establishing a clear connection between the two. It also introduces the Bernie Sanders movement without explaining how it can reverse the damage.
Fluency: 5 - The story has some awkward sentence structures and lacks a cohesive flow of ideas.

Once upon a time, in the early days of the internet, an enterprising entrepreneur named Paul Deneve created a new business that he thought would "help people buy stuff without actually having to think about the cost." He called it Paypal, and he sold it to eBay in 1998 for $3.5 billion, earning Deneve a small fortune. Paypal has morphed over the years, morphing from an online money-transfer company into a payment processor with offices across North America. But it has only recently begun to attract attention from some of the brightest minds in tech, most notably Bill Gates. Last week, Deneve announced plans to expand Paypal's reach even wider among those who don't have access to banks: on-demand, peer-to-peer loans.
Consistency: 8 - The story portrays the evolution of Paypal from an online money-transfer company to a payment processor expanding into on-demand, peer-to-peer loans. It maintains a consistent focus on the growth and developments of the company.
Fluency: 9 - The story is well-written with smooth sentences and a clear progression of events.

Once upon a time, this year marks the release of an entirely new version of Ubuntu. That version has now been announced. While several Ubuntu 15.04 updates were previously announced, the release is now being called 'Ubuntu 15.10'. The version number is simply 15.10, though'release' seems like a better title for such a big release. One of the key elements of the new release, Canonical told me, is the Unity desktop, and the inclusion of an updated version of the GNOME desktop. "The default desktop environment used by millions of Ubuntu users is now at version 4.10, and it has been streamlined to make it easier to use and understand," the company wrote in a blog post. "Ubuntu 15.10 also introduces many of the new features introduced in Ubuntu 16.04 LTS.
Consistency: 7 - The story maintains a consistent theme of the release of a new version of Ubuntu and the features it includes. However, there is a slight inconsistency in the mention of Ubuntu 15.04 updates and the new release being called Ubuntu 15.10.
Fluency: 7 - The story flows relatively smoothly, but there are a few fragmented sentences and awkward phrasing that disrupt the overall fluency.

Once upon a time, I had to make my own shampoo. It was a very stressful, time-consuming and very expensive endeavor. You can make your own hair shampoo now, but you need a lot of expensive ingredients and ingredients like glycerin, which is another reason many salon mousses don't advertise using their products as their own is because they're afraid of losing customers. You can have all the shampoo you want but if there are soaps, oils and styling foams that you can't use, I'm afraid your life as an oil-free person is very much limited. Also, many people do have their own recipes that call for specific ingredients. It's not that difficult to figure out. It's how you adapt something that's been used for forever that can vary among different brands and different recipes.
Consistency: 4 - The story lacks consistency as it jumps from discussing making shampoo to the limitations of using certain products. There is a lack of a clear connection between the different points mentioned.
Fluency: 5 - The story has several fragmented sentences and awkward phrasing, which hinders the fluency. There is also a lack of clear progression in the story.

Once upon a time, it was thought that the brain function represented the entire system, hence there was a huge emphasis placed on studying the brain by using methods that were specifically designed to do so. By the 1970s, most scientists were convinced that the brain is an entirely distributed and modular structure (not a hierarchy), whereas in earlier times it had been thought that the brain was a compartmentalized structure. Thus, the brain became a much more interesting and important subject than previously thought, not because of any particular discoveries made in the laboratory, but mainly because of the new conceptual understanding put forward by such phenomena as consciousness. "What we call, for the first time, consciousness is an interaction between neurons." At this point in time, it was actually becoming fashionable to speak in this fashion rather than in the more restricted manner that had prevailed for the past half century or so.
Consistency: 6 - The story introduces the idea of changing scientific perspectives on the brain, but the connection between the different concepts is not clearly established. The mention of consciousness also feels somewhat disconnected from the main theme.
Fluency: 7 - The story has relatively cohesive sentences, but there are a few instances of awkward phrasing that affect the fluency. The progression of ideas could also be clearer.

Once upon a time, when our family, friends, and colleagues were still living with our parents, after having completed elementary and high schools, we all came into the family's home to watch a televised political campaign debate that featured all the candidates for the office of chief executive. In that case, the first person to speak was Donald Trump. So we watched him in the debate while my father-in-law, the chief executive's father-in-law, observed and commented on the candidates' remarks. The first thing I noticed was how, in this debate, the candidates were never able to answer the other candidate's questions with the simple answer: "That's simple. Ask a question." I then looked closer at the candidates' speeches. The speech Trump was delivering was an example of the most basic form of argumentation.
Consistency: 7 - The story follows a consistent theme of watching a political debate and analyzing the candidates' speeches. However, there are some tangential details that are not directly relevant to the main theme.
Fluency: 7 - The story flows relatively smoothly, but there are some awkwardly constructed sentences and unclear connections between ideas. The progression of events could also be more cohesive.

Once upon a time, as you know, the government of the United States decided to ban the selling of soft drinks, because they were made with so many additives that they were harmful to kids. And because there are a lot of cities in the country that prohibit smoking on government buildings. And because, as is the custom here in New York, people put bumper stickers on their cars and they say, "Gee, I think it's really dangerous to run a car on gasoline." What we had thought was the reason for these laws is that it's good public policy not to allow the sale of foods in our society with high levels of nutrition and health threats. Because, you know, there is no need for our tax dollars to be used to support companies with unhealthy habits.
Consistency: 2 - The story lacks consistency and coherence. It jumps abruptly between different ideas and topics without clear connections. The mentions of soft drink bans, smoking prohibitions, bumper stickers, and tax dollars do not form a cohesive narrative. 
Fluency: 5 - The sentences are grammatically correct and the story generally flows with a clear progression. However, the abrupt jumps between topics make it less fluent. 

Once upon a time, a long, long time ago, I would have considered this guy the most promising quarterback in college football. Then came those two things, and a lot of teams made changes. "Now, we have a guy who's a really, really good quarterback [Deshaun Watson] who is our starting quarterback. We have a young guy [Watson] at the helm who is not just taking some snaps under center, but it's his job to lead us." I know you have to take the good with the bad, and this is going to sound really, really dumb to people who don't like your team, but that's the way it is, and that's a good thing. The world keeps turning, and you have an opportunity to figure out a way to win without having to change all of your philosophies. Your guys are good. The defense is probably the only real question mark.
Consistency: 6 - The story starts with the mention of a promising quarterback, then transitions to talking about a different quarterback as the starter. While there is a connection between the two, the story could benefit from better cohesion and clearer transitions. 
Fluency: 7 - The sentences are coherent and flow relatively smoothly. The repetition of phrases like "really, really" takes away from the fluency slightly. 

Once upon a time, the game showed players who took the most risks would be rewarded. But now it's all a sham. All the risks are paid-for by a few. The players don't get anything in return; nothing they can be proud of. So why take risks of any sort? Because every risk will come with a reward. And the better the outcome, the more the team can be proud of itself. So the longer you play, the better chances you'll have to reap the rewards. I am well aware that I may alienate those who do not enjoy risk and uncertainty. But the truth is the opposite: a team that is uncertain about itself is a team that is losing. A team will lose when it is unsure of itself. Without doubt, the reason for this is that it does not trust its own ability, has difficulties in finding itself and therefore cannot trust its teammates because they are unknown.
Consistency: 4 - The story discusses risks and rewards, but the overall narrative lacks coherence and clear connections between ideas. It seems to be trying to convey a message about uncertainty and trust but does so in a disjointed manner. 
Fluency: 6 - The sentences are generally grammatically correct, but the flow is disrupted by disjointed ideas and unclear connections. 

Once upon a time I had no love at all," she wrote. "I had spent my young adult life being told that I was too fat, too ugly, to play sports, that there wasn't room in a gym to work out without a shirt. I was told I could never measure up. I was told I wasn't good enough, that I could never be a player or a model." She didn't know what having kids meant; she didn't know where her son and daughter went to school; but she was determined to be the best mom she could be. And so her daughter Natalie, an Ohio State track and basketball player, became her motivation, and she became a full-time mom. She got used to it. Soon she was in the gym and on her feet. When she was ready for her first dance recital, after graduation in 2009, her family traveled to the dance studio in New York City.
Consistency: 7 - The story follows a narrative of a woman's journey from feeling unloved to becoming a dedicated mother. While the narrative is generally coherent, there are some abrupt transitions and slightly disjointed ideas. 
Fluency: 8 - The story flows smoothly with clear sentences and a coherent progression of events. There are some minor syntax issues and repetitive phrases that slightly affect fluency.

Once upon a time, a high-profile legal case had the potential to set a precedent for how judges could evaluate their own work. More generally, the case of Halbig v. Burwell dealt with religious objections to the government requiring companies to offer their employees free contraceptives. Despite the fact that the plaintiffs faced a lengthy legal process to gain access to contraception, the case was important from a public policy perspective. The federal government had sought to require employers to cover contraception for religious exemptions, and the Court took a public policy view: if the government can force religious people to use government funding, then it can force them to not use government funding as well. In that sense, the Halbig decision was a test case for government intervention in personal issues, a test that many courts may soon face. The second case is United States v. Windsor.
Consistency: 7 - The story maintains a consistent theme of government intervention in personal issues and the potential implications for religious exemptions. However, the transition from discussing the Halbig case to mentioning the United States v. Windsor case feels abrupt and unrelated.
Fluency: 6 - The story has a clear progression of events, but the sentences are long and some ideas could be more succinctly expressed.

Once upon a time, I made a post about how I had to buy a new laptop for my kids. They were both so young. The computer cost approximately $2000 which was crazy in those times when a $350 laptop sold for $5000 when new. They had no money. But, the first thing they said is "Mom, that is just too much money, how can we afford that?" Because if you have to pay that much for a laptop, then you are going to spend $10,000 for a house even if it is a 1 bedroom or $100,000 for a 4 bedroom house. As you can see from the comments, it is no surprise that you don't hear a lot about the financial picture for middle class kids these days. I will end with a quote that sums things up nicely: If you have to buy $1000 for a house, then you don't have $1000 with you.
Consistency: 2 - The story lacks coherence and consistency. It starts with a discussion about buying a laptop but quickly transitions to discussing the financial struggles of middle-class kids. There is also no clear connection between the initial laptop purchase and the ending quote about not having enough money for a house.
Fluency: 4 - The story has fragmented and disjointed sentences, making it difficult to follow the narration.

Once upon a time, there was a guy who was in love with his co-worker. But the only thing he really cared about in life was making it to Monday morning. When it came to sex, he'd never wanted anything to do with her. The day he finally broke down and demanded sex from her, she said no. He continued to ask but again, she said no. But that's all for the good. In the end, this guy ended up alone, and had to accept a better-paying job. By the end of the week, he had to get a new job to make ends meet. He went back to her apartment, where this was the first time she'd given him oral sex. He asked her if she wanted to do it again, and she said yes. And once again, he said no—and she was never the same. His relationship with her never recovered. Advertisement 8.
Consistency: 2 - The story lacks coherence and consistency. It starts with a man being in love with his co-worker but quickly jumps to his desire for sex and their unresolved relationship issues. The unexpected mention of an advertisement at the end adds further confusion.
Fluency: 5 - The sentences are generally coherent, but the sudden shifts in topic make the story feel disjointed and confusing.

Once upon a time, there was a young man living in the desert, and he would go wandering across the desert while he searched for his lost love. The night before his search, his lover left him in the darkness, without his money, his belongings, or food, and sent this message to him. "Go eat that scorpion!" The man took that scorpion from his bag and ate it just as it begged to come out in front of him, hoping to bite him in the middle of his path. He did not, and then another scorpion came out. The man put this last scorpion back in his bag and continued on his way, but that night, as he was walking, he noticed that a hole was punched into the ground, but no scorpion was there. He was about to return home to wait for another scorpion to show itself out in front of him, but it did not show up.
Consistency: 7 - The story maintains a consistent theme of a man searching for his lost love in the desert. However, the sudden introduction of scorpions and their significance is not adequately explained or integrated into the narrative.
Fluency: 6 - The sentences flow reasonably well, but the story lacks clarity in connecting the man's actions with the presence of scorpions and their disappearance.

Once upon a time..." "Wait a minute! What's this about a long lost friend and a long lost brother?" "Oh well, a long lost brother who has been stuck in here for decades." Pyrrha waved the book back and forth. "And... a long, long time ago..." The book fell a little from its perch as the page turned, and revealed some information inside it. TOOOONNNN? What's going to happen to my friends...? And now, so many people want to know... "Pyrrha!" Jaune cried. "We promised. You told us, as long as these two guys agreed to come here, we'd keep this secret! So, what's the secret?" Pyrrha frowned as she saw Jaune standing there. He had not been this excited since the night before.
Consistency: 6 - The story starts with a mysterious long-lost friend and brother, then shifts to Pyrrha reading from a book, and finally involves Jaune wanting to know the secret. The transitions are not very smooth and the story feels a bit disjointed.
Fluency: 5 - The sentences are fragmented and sometimes unclear, making the flow of the story choppy and confusing.

Once upon a time I thought we had a chance at breaking through to winning when I ran alongside the runner, at the end of our race," she says, then switches gears. "But this is about real things. I want her and my friend to be OK. I hope this helps you to deal with your fear of what he might become." Her message for others is simple. "Do what your parents want you to do. Go out and enjoy it. Don't look back, don't ask if someone loves you, and be the best person you can be." It could apply to just about any parent facing children who are gay.
Consistency: 7 - The story starts with a race and then shifts to a message for others. While the themes of perseverance and acceptance are consistent, the transition between these two parts could be smoother.
Fluency: 6 - The sentences are a bit disjointed and the story lacks a clear structure. Some parts could be more clearly connected for a smoother flow.

Once upon a time, the US government took the position that its foreign policy was centered on the preservation of US power and influence across the globe. Today, the focus of American foreign policy is largely domestic, a result of both the US budget deficit and the decline of the US military, with the government now focused on combating "terrorism." During his speech, President Obama made remarks on the rise of the Islamic State and the rise of terror groups in general, but largely failed to mention IS. He mentioned the group at only one point during his speech: after President Putin had previously claimed that Russia had been involved in the attacks in Paris. While the statement suggests that President Obama may have been hinting at Moscow's involvement in the attacks that took place in Paris on Friday, it could simply be a slip up, as the President may have been trying to say something that is slightly different from the one he actually stated.
Consistency: 8 - The story maintains a consistent theme of US foreign policy, discussing changes over time and President Obama's speech. The focus on terrorism is also consistent throughout.
Fluency: 7 - The sentences are generally coherent, but some parts could be more clearly articulated for a smoother flow. The story could also benefit from a clearer structure and progression of ideas.

Once upon a time", "You were standing on the edge of the ocean" and more. What makes this game great is the fact that you are not solely limited on the screen. Every little action can be done by pushing the "X" button. As a result, you can move the character around wherever you wish and jump up and down, and more. By pressing the "X" button on the side of the player's ship, you can open the ship's menu. Here you can change the ship's speed, activate its cloaking device, and more. But as you can see, it does not change the fact that you are controlling one simple robot. When you press the "X" button, you will automatically take the action the ship has chosen for you. After having successfully built a huge robot, the ship and its crew have gathered at a nearby space station. They wish to head to the station's surface as soon as possible.
Consistency: 7 - The story starts with a game and then shifts to controlling a robot and building a ship. While the theme of control and progression is consistent, the transitions between these parts could be smoother.
Fluency: 6 - The sentences are choppy and sometimes unclear, making the flow of the story a bit disjointed. The story could benefit from clearer and smoother sentence structures.

Once upon a time, most of us worked in businesses. We didn't have that freedom. If we got sick or something, we were forced to stay at our place. We didn't do anything. This was the way things were. And it was fine. People had their moments to have fun with friends and get outside. But in the business, this became the norm. It was a matter of time when we started noticing that we were becoming less and less active. We all tried to find a way to do something. For the most part, we failed and were disappointed. The only people who seemed to get it were young kids. The ones who were in the band or were just playing at home, and still a young crew that had played together for a while. That was probably the best way to do it. So, we started to believe that it must be natural to get sick.
Consistency: 4 - The story lacks consistency and jumps between different topics and ideas without clear connections.
Fluency: 5 - The sentences are not very cohesive and the story does not flow smoothly. There are some grammatical errors and awkward phrases.

Once upon a time in England, when the Queen had her coronation, one of her most beloved courtiers was a little brat. He was a little girl who always went to the Queen. He was the prettiest one of the whole bunch. All the girls were jealous of him. So the Queen went out of order. She went to look for the little girl in the streets. She went to the street corners at night and asked for her. She went out when the streetlights were out. Sometimes she stayed for a long time, wandering around the streets. One night when the little girl had been looking for her for an hour, a man who was passing by thought: "I can get her." His wife looked after the little girl, and he thought: "When I get my money, I'll make my wife, my mistress, take to her as a mistress.
Consistency: 2 - The story is confusing and lacks coherence. The transitions between sentences and ideas are not clear.
Fluency: 2 - The sentences are poorly constructed and the story does not flow well. There are numerous grammatical errors and the language is unclear.

Once upon a time, I had an obsession with the movie, The Shining (1980) about a family of seven who are holed up at a Colorado hotel over the course of several weeks following the murder of an employee and the subsequent death of their mother. It was by far my most vivid fantasy of the last fifty years, as well as the most complex, involving several supernatural events occurring at once and the search to find "The One" that would get them out of there. In order to accomplish this, they would travel to hell and try to force themselves back to life, or try to go there by themselves. The most disturbing part about the movie was seeing it unfold, particularly in the scenes involving the Satanic rituals taking place within the hotel. My idea of "The One" was a strong woman, an attractive young woman, and a very intelligent one.
Consistency: 6 - The story maintains consistency in the theme of obsession with a movie, but it includes some unrelated elements like supernatural events and the search for "The One."
Fluency: 7 - The sentences are somewhat cohesive and the story has a logical progression. However, there are some awkward phrases and unclear descriptions.

Once upon a time you put the box of chocolates in the fridge to eat them later, now, we can just let them go. And, you're welcome, I've had about enough.  This dish is one of the easiest to perfect, and yet, I made three giant batches, so I could have two for this week's menu.  Because that's what I do in my house, and in my life.  Chocolate mousse, chocolate chip cookies and a chocolate chip cookie crust are the three main ingredients in this amazing chocolate chip cookie pie. I made the pie in a 9 x 5 x 2 gal. cake pan. For the crust, I made the simplest crust I could think of. The recipe calls for all white flour, melted and chilled so I just added one egg, one teaspoon of baking soda and a few tsp. of salt, then folded it.
Consistency: 7 - The story maintains consistency in the theme of chocolate recipes, but it jumps between different types of desserts without clear transitions.
Fluency: 7 - The sentences are fairly cohesive and the story flows reasonably well. However, there are some repetitive phrases and the language could be more polished.

Once upon a time, an elderly gentleman was walking along when someone asked him if he wanted to see a little bit of American history. He replied. 'No thank you, I want to buy some stuff.' Not only did he fail to hear his own question clearly, he also failed to perceive that he was being politely asked not to buy whatever it was that a store owner was selling." "We were on a mission. No matter what kind of person that is, we all know that, at the end of the day, money matters. We were there to protect what was left of the middle class in America." "As you know, if two men are drinking cognac and eating the same kind of cake, they both probably didn't get any cake, anyway." "So let's try again.
Consistency: 5 - The story lacks consistency as it jumps from an elderly gentleman being asked about American history to a mission to protect the middle class to a discussion about two men drinking cognac and eating cake.
Fluency: 4 - The story is not fluently constructed, as the sentences do not flow smoothly and there is a lack of coherent progression of events.

Once upon a time, most large companies did just that. But if they did that, they would not be able to compete effectively with the tech industry. By now a great many executives have been persuaded that there's nothing special about their own companies. So, in the absence of a serious competitor, they prefer to do things the other way around: they want to hire the best software engineers they can find, even if this means paying less. Because of this, the best engineers from other companies, often from places like Japan and Korea, are drawn out of their traditional home countries and trained in California. The companies that employ them then try to bring their skills back home for the same reason that they do: because such people generally have a better attitude about working for less. This in turn pushes many engineers, especially young ones, even more to leave California and set up their own companies.
Consistency: 7 - The story maintains consistency in its focus on large companies and their hiring practices, as well as the movement of engineers. However, the transition between different points could be smoother.
Fluency: 6 - The story is somewhat fluent, but there are instances where the sentences could be more cohesive and the narrative progression could be clearer.

Once upon a time there was a certain company on New York's lower East Side, which wanted to make their mark by making the world's first computerized braille printer. But their dream was stifled by bad weather, and the venture failed. Then came a period of great change. Suddenly something had to be done about bad computerized software. And so the industry was changed, with the first fully programmable text file system and the first printable-text printer. The first thing I did was figure out what I was going to write up. The main things I figured I needed to write down were the main capabilities of the computerized braille printer. And I went through a process of thinking about these capabilities. The one you'll read about in the book is called the "Braille Algorithm." The system does some things that make sure that the printout of information is readable by even someone with a very badly broken or damaged vision.
Consistency: 6 - The story starts with a company wanting to create a braille printer but then transitions to discussing computerized software and the capabilities of the printer. The shift in focus is not well connected.
Fluency: 7 - The story flows relatively smoothly, though there could be improvements in the transition between different ideas and concepts.

Once upon a time, in the land of my birth, I was a man of science. One day, my friend asked me: "Gee, you're a scientist? How do you have a kid?" It was a question that gave me pause. In fact, I was more interested in his children... My partner at the time was also interested in how our science would play with children. I wondered how I could teach my kids that we live in our world, and that our decisions had real consequences. At the same time, I don't think kids should have to hide their science experiments, or take special science classes at school. In fact, I'd love to see a little more of a science focus in school. I think that kids should feel that science isn't a boring, theoretical subject.
Consistency: 7 - The story follows a consistent theme of the protagonist being a man of science and discussing the importance of science education for children. However, the inclusion of the partner's thoughts on children and science feels somewhat disconnected.
Fluency: 8 - The story flows well with generally cohesive sentences and a clear progression of ideas.

Once upon a time I used to be a good kid," writes the young boy, and then a series of flashbacks set in the first-grade years of the child show how his father used to abuse him—physically and emotionally. As the boy grew older he began using his mother's cocaine and later heroin, and finally the drugs in his mother's blood during pregnancy. "I'm not ashamed," the boy's father writes. In a poem, he expresses his wish to be an older man so he can "get even": I wish for a little time ago I had been a parent With a soul and body like yours and the right kind of luck... I'd have given everything I had To see you well... ... I wish for a little longer I had been a parent With the same heart and soul I showed you I could've saved a life, Or taught all you would need to know...
Consistency: 5 - The story jumps between different themes and elements, including abuse, drug use, and regret. There is some consistency in the exploration of the boy's troubled upbringing, but the transitions between flashbacks and the father's perspective could be smoother.
Fluency: 7 - The sentences are mostly coherent and connected, but there are some abrupt transitions and fragmented thoughts that disrupt the flow of the story.

Once upon a time, the American people were told over and over and over again that a free society needed to be based on an authoritarian model of governance--that government needed to be powerful, that the government might have the power to use force or the threat of force to achieve its goals. In other words, government was the problem. The United States did not have to go that way. In fact, the Constitution was designed not to make government powerful, but to protect and empower the freedoms we have in this country. We have a very different definition of power—and freedom— than the Founders of this country had in mind. That is, we are supposed to have freedom when government's actions don't infringe our rights.
Consistency: 8 - The story maintains a consistent theme of contrasting views on government power and its impact on freedom. It highlights the importance of the Constitution and the intentions of the Founding Fathers.
Fluency: 9 - The sentences are well-structured and flow smoothly, effectively conveying the ideas and arguments being presented.

Once upon a time, it was the norm that no one would come up to me for any reason, because they would make fun of my height, and make other assumptions about my personality. Now, there's such an overwhelming trend that women who like me come up to me and introduce themselves, then apologize for their actions in hopes it would get through to me. Recently, on Halloween, one of my friends sent a message "Do you like blondes?" After I responded with "What?", that's when I got a message "You should go on the dating app Grindr so you can see if you like blondes. It's free." Why was she trying to get me on Grindr? Was she trying to get some attention? I just said "No," and we didn't exchange any more messages. I thought that was kinda weird. I didn't know if she was a gay guy or just someone who liked to get some attention.
Consistency: 6 - The story touches on various themes, including bullying, self-image, and social interactions. However, there is a lack of clear connection or progression among these elements.
Fluency: 7 - The sentences are generally understandable, but there are some grammatical errors and unclear expressions that hinder the fluency of the story.

Once upon a time, there was a popular fantasy franchise known as King Arthur. In this world, there lived a wizard who could call forth the legendary swords known as Excalibur and Excalibur. Every seven years, the kingdom would hold a tournament where four Knights would fight to prove themselves. One Knight would have the Excalibur while the other three would carry the Excalibur's sister, Fionn. The two Excalibur blades would be locked together in a sealed tomb called the Holy Grail. The winner would claim Fionn and win the sword's power. The Excalibur. It would only be wielded upon the death of the last remaining Knight that wielded it. If the knight's name was not read from the holy seal, the blade would become dormant for seven years. When the seven years were up, it would be released by the wizard who had the Excalibur.
Consistency: 7 - The story introduces a fantasy world with elements of King Arthur and magical swords. However, there is some confusion and inconsistency in the details and rules surrounding the swords and the Holy Grail.
Fluency: 8 - The sentences are mostly coherent, but there are a few instances where the narrative jumps abruptly or uses awkward phrasing, slightly affecting the fluency of the story.

Once upon a time, we had an argument about how the game works, and how to resolve this problem. I tried to make changes, but was only able to make some basic changes, like changing character's attack and evasion values. The only improvements we were able to achieve were some minor, temporary fixes. But for those of you who don't know, the bug was to change an enemy's attack to attack another enemy, and I said that you wouldn't be able to reproduce this bug. It would be something the enemy would have to learn very early on. As it turned out, this bug was so easy to fix that I was able to fix several others in the same day! I guess that if I made changes to just one stat value, the game would be balanced, right? Well, that's what all of us think, so I didn't try the change.
Consistency: 6 - The story starts with an argument about a bug in a game, but then transitions to discussing the possibility of balancing the game with stat changes. The connection between these elements is not clear and could be improved for better consistency.
Fluency: 7 - The story has mostly cohesive sentences, but there are a few instances where the flow is interrupted by unnecessary repetition or fragmented thoughts.

Once upon a time (and I hope I don't have to take responsibility for any puns...), Microsoft used to make their own OSes, sometimes called Windows, and other times called NT; it was a common practice, and in a way it was a bit shameful how many Microsoft fans would go on and on about how they only use Microsoft when it was in "the right time and the right place". Windows NT 3.1/2000/XP/2003 was in a different group, because I personally was one of its main users. (Although the product is now officially called Windows 7, it remains an NT product in name only.) But as of 2006, Microsoft is no longer making any of its own OSes, they have to use Linux. So, I have to admit there have come a long time when I have been missing it. As an interesting detail, there is no actual Windows NT anymore...
Consistency: 4 - The story jumps between discussing Microsoft's OSes, the author's personal experience, and the use of Linux without clear connections between these elements. It lacks a cohesive narrative thread.
Fluency: 6 - The story contains some rambling and disjointed sentences, making it less fluent and harder to follow.

Once upon a time there were several thousand homeless people in Toronto - that number has now shrunk to about 4,000. So why is the city doing everything it can to keep them homeless? "The most important thing is that it helps get them housed first," John Starchuk, Toronto's director of social services, told CBC News last month. Starchuk said people without shelter - homeless or not - tend to have more health problems: sleeping on the streets or in cars or parked in people's parking lots. Toronto could do more to help residents Although Starchuk says the city's strategy of focusing on a high-risk group makes sense, the Toronto Coalition for the Homeless points out many of the city's most vulnerable communities actually have the best chance of getting into housing.
Consistency: 7 - The story discusses the homeless population in Toronto and the city's efforts to address the issue. However, the transition from discussing homeless people to the strategy of focusing on a high-risk group could be smoother for better consistency.
Fluency: 8 - The story flows well with clear sentences, although there are a few instances where the structure could be improved for better fluency.

Once upon a time, it was believed that blackouts were caused by nuclear war. According to this conventional wisdom, a nuclear blast would result in the vaporized shells of the blast exploding simultaneously, causing a complete electrical blackout throughout the globe. This theory was first proposed by James Van Allen in 1958, and was further expanded back in 1965 by scientist John Logsdon by observing a nuclear bomb test detonate in the desert. Van Allen, who was a physicist by industry standards, was not a nuclear scientist himself. Logsdon, although more of a mathematician, was well-known by the military-industrial complex. His research was further expanded upon by scientist Gordon Cooper. It wasn't until 1980, in fact, that the first full-scale nuclear test was even conducted in the United States. By then, it had become obvious to everyone that the theory was completely false. Why was this so? Because a nuclear missile was a very small nuclear explosion compared to a nuclear bomb.
Consistency: 5 - The story starts with the theory that blackouts are caused by nuclear war, then delves into the history of this theory and introduces various scientists. The connection between the initial theory and the subsequent information about nuclear weapons could be clarified for better consistency.
Fluency: 7 - The story has some sentence structures that could be improved for better fluency, but overall it is readable with a clear progression of ideas.

Once upon a time, a former president once described the Supreme Court's ruling in Roe v. Wade as "the supreme law of the land". The current president has not yet invoked that phrase, in part because the Supreme Court does not have a case that could lead to such a step. But in his State of the Union Address last month, to the Congress, he said this: "We should not turn back time. We were robbed of the opportunity the Framers gave us to fix this right in the Constitution. In the words of the poet: 'Let time undo the wrongs of time'. We deserve a bill of rights, and I promise you, I will get it for you, and your children, and your children's children. My fellow Americans, today, more Americans can vote, and it doesn't matter if you lived 25 years ago, or 20 years ago, or 10 years ago.
Consistency: 7 - The story discusses the Supreme Court's ruling in Roe v. Wade and the current president's stance on it, but then transitions to a discussion about voting rights. The connection between these elements is not very clear and could be improved for better consistency.
Fluency: 8 - The story has mostly cohesive sentences and flows well, although there are a few instances where the structure could be improved for better fluency.

Once upon a time, the idea of a high energy nuclear reactor was pretty much unheard of. The idea, which had become reality after the discovery of thorium by Sir William Crookes in 1881, was that uranium in a high temperature and neutron rich molten state could be used to create nuclear weapons. In reality, what is known as thorium reactors – made with uranium-228 – are still a relatively new phenomenon. However, a Russian corporation, TVEL, has been trying to commercialise the technology ever since the mid-1980s, but is yet to even open a commercial reactor facility. But now, a company called Energoatom has just opened the world's first commercial thorium reactor. The company had previously been developing a similar design using uranium oxide called the MIR 6 reactor, which, when operating at full capacity, would produce 20 MWe of thermal energy.
Consistency: 9 - The story discusses the development and commercialization of high energy nuclear reactors, specifically thorium reactors. It maintains a clear and consistent theme throughout.
Fluency: 9 - The story flows smoothly with clear and cohesive sentences, effectively conveying the information.

Once upon a time, when I was starting at the beginning and I was trying to figure out what the world was even, the answer seemed pretty clear. It seemed simple: it's a matter of energy, you know? The whole concept of space and time really became clear to me when I stumbled upon an idea of a force which is not a force at all. It's not a photon, it doesn't come from space - this has always seemed to me to be really obvious. It came to me when I realized we have the fact of a force that is not a photon in space, in spacetime. And I thought, I'm just going to go off and call it the 'zero-point field'...  P: Let me take another question from the phone and then I'm going to move on to one more issue that's been hanging around in the background.
Consistency: 6 - The story starts with a discussion about the concept of energy and then transitions to the idea of a force, specifically the zero-point field. The connection between these elements is not very clear and could be improved for better consistency.
Fluency: 7 - The story has some fragmented thoughts and repetitive sentences, making it less fluent and harder to follow at times.

Once upon a time, when every child's plaything was a rubber hammer, there was little concern that they'd start hitting each other. Children play at home, they'll keep playing, they'll play until they're hurt. Until all other forms of play have been abandoned forever, boys will still play with each other. Sometimes they'll hit each other with some sharp object, and then, the plaything being a toy, they'll talk about how they'd like to hit each other with a real hammer. They'll start imagining it as such. They don't have to talk about it, they just do it. That might be cute, but it's bad form. It's an attempt to hide one's behavior, to avoid responsibility for one's actions. Even though it's a harmless joke, that's not going to get them anywhere. That's just another way of saying, "I can't be responsible for what I do.
Consistency: 6 - The story starts by discussing children's play with rubber hammers and then transitions to discussing hitting each other with sharp objects. The connection between these elements is not very clear and could be improved for better consistency.
Fluency: 7 - The story has some repetitive phrases and fragmented thoughts, making it less fluent and harder to follow at times.

Once upon a time I was an ardent Democrat for many years and now I am registered Republican. I decided to switch parties as I no longer feel satisfied with the direction the country is heading in – I don't have much hope in either side but I am more attracted to the concept of liberty, independence, individualism and individual liberty, being able to make your own life decisions, have choice, not having to submit. The Democrats are more progressive, have an 'entitlement culture,' support statism and the Federal Reserve, and want to take away the gun rights of the American people with no Constitutional restrictions. The Republicans are much smaller, I see few signs of strength in Obama or the Democrats, but I do hope someone on the right will rise to take their place in the mid-term elections.
Consistency: 6 - The story discusses the switch in political parties from Democrat to Republican, but then jumps to discussing the attributes of Democrats and Republicans without a clear connection between these elements. The story lacks a cohesive narrative thread.
Fluency: 6 - The story contains fragmented thoughts and repetitive phrases, making it less fluent and harder to follow at times.

Once upon a time, there stood in the shadow of the palace the tallest and most splendid of all castles made for the honor and elevation of its chief. It rose in the air all of gold, its walls and tower were gold, its gates and ramparts gold, its towers and ramparts were all of gold, its gates all of gold. All of it. From top to bottom it was covered with gilt and its floor and roof, with gilt. What could be finer? There was gold and there was silver and there were gems and there was everything you might imagine. It was a magnificent piece of work. But it was in ruins now; broken into a hundred pieces, each one of them was more beautiful than the last; but each of them was alone on the earth. The castle stood that night so alone; and from the palace we went alone, we, alone. "I will go next to the window," said I.
Consistency: 9 - The story describes a magnificent golden castle that is now in ruins, maintaining a consistent theme throughout.
Fluency: 9 - The story flows smoothly with descriptive sentences and a clear progression of events.

Once upon a time, I used to use a few different types of crayons to sketch out designs. All were plastic and did not leave the lines of the original art on my hands much at all. If you are not a painter, I recommend using those! When I took up drawing digitally, I found a few websites where I could find a variety of pencils and crayons. As a beginner, I liked using them to get things started but quickly adapted my drawing style to be more like professional artists did when they were actually trying to produce real paintings. There are some really great sites on the internet dedicated solely to digital art for beginners. This one in particular is amazing and has thousands of beautiful art pieces to look at. However, if you want some digital art, you are limited to most of the pencil and crayon sites.
Consistency: 7 - The story starts with discussing the use of different crayons for sketching, then transitions to using digital art tools and beginner resources. The connection between traditional and digital art could be clarified for better consistency.
Fluency: 8 - The story has mostly cohesive sentences, although there are a few instances where the structure could be improved for better fluency.

Once upon a time, before the internet, this was how people exchanged information. Back then, you had to find the book at the library, or mail-order it. Now, everyone has access to all sorts of information thanks to the internet or their smartphone, and they are much more willing to share it with others. When I first started reading, I was only doing it to get laid (I'm sure you've heard that refrain in a number of sex-positive/sex-positive groups). Reading a book made me feel like, "I know I'm going to be really good at this, because there's nothing I'm not good at, so I'm going to be really good at it." So, with the internet, we no longer need to go to a library to read. In addition, with access to books, we can also read them aloud while listening to someone else read it to us. With voice-to-text software like Vocal.
Consistency: 7 - The story discusses the exchange of information before and after the internet, but then transitions to personal motivations for reading. The connection between these elements is not clear and could be improved for better consistency.
Fluency: 8 - The story flows well with clear sentences, although there are a few instances where the structure could be improved for better fluency.

Once upon a time, in an old movie, an old man says – I wish I'd thought of that! A year ago, the great Tom DeBlass made a very wise statement that if you didn't think of your own idea, then nothing would come of it. Well, I suppose I had in mind my idea to go back to the drawing board, and to try to be truly "in love" with the world, rather than having been brought up to believe that that might be the way that I had to feel about the world. I have become much more relaxed now that I know that I have a better idea of the world I want to live in. And I've had that feeling ever since I embarked on the process of "finding myself" by exploring why I found it difficult to connect with other people. I would have been very surprised to know that I had a problem with connecting with people.
Consistency: 7 - The story jumps between various ideas and themes, such as the importance of thinking for oneself, finding love for the world, connecting with others, and personal problems. While these ideas are somewhat related, the story lacks a clear focus or central message.

Once upon a time (it seems), there was a time when we could get away with doing simple things like giving people hugs or letting them pick our noses. Back then, we could just point at someone on the street and tell them that "our" friend would like to meet them. Today, people are no longer allowed to ignore their friends. They're not allowed to ask for a hug. They're definitely not allowed to talk about their life without mentioning their problems — and when they want to talk, it's to a small group of people. What we're left with is a society where every single person knows the person right next to them at least four of five days of the year, but only a few will have actually visited that person. People have become so busy with their own problems that they'll do almost anything to avoid talking to each other or having human contact. "How sad is it when we turn people into objects.
Consistency: 7 - The story discusses the changes in societal norms and the lack of personal connection among people. However, it also mentions hugging, picking noses, and turning people into objects, which may be unrelated or unclear in their relevance to the main theme.
Fluency: 8 - The sentences are generally well-constructed and flow smoothly. There are a few instances where the structure could be improved, but overall, the story is fairly fluent.

Once upon a time, people believed that a person's gender was a part of their natural makeup. The only difference between a man and a woman was the sex of the biological parent. This natural gender concept, known as biological sex, was the root cause of gender identity disorder, the medical-sounding name for gender dysphoria. But today, according to experts at the endocrine institute at the University of California, San Francisco, the vast majority of transgender people, including transgender people like myself, know something is wrong with their bodies, not their minds. In the late 19th century, American physicians began diagnosing transgender persons with hysteria, a severe form of mental illness often associated with abuse, prostitution and suicide. And in the 20th century, doctors began to treat gender-conforming children with gender-affirming hormones and surgeries, thereby making transgender children the first truly "sex-changing" children.
Consistency: 6 - The story starts by discussing the concept of gender and then transitions to talking about transgender people and their experiences throughout history. While these ideas are connected, the story's progression is not entirely clear and lacks a cohesive narrative.
Fluency: 7 - The sentences are relatively coherent, but there are instances where the language could be more concise and the structure more refined. The transitions between ideas could also be smoother.

Once upon a time a "Cute Girl" came to my house and said they had to talk to me about you. They said you used to beat up your girlfriends, but you finally did it on me. I could hear them through the door, so I came outside. You must have been pissed, because you didn't seem like the kind of guy to care. You looked sad, with your eyes and mouth drawn up like a mannish boy. I could tell that you were a weak, ugly, pathetic little boy. You looked like a little chica, and you sat down on one side of the couch, with your hands folded neatly on the table. "Hey, what's up?" I asked as I sat down. "You never liked me," you told me in a sad voice. "No, I didn't like you back, either. You always had to remind me to call you by your name and call you mom.
Consistency: 5 - The story begins by introducing a "Cute Girl" and then moves to describing a confrontation with an abusive person. The connection between the two parts is not explicitly established, making the story somewhat inconsistent.
Fluency: 6 - The sentences are short and choppy, lacking a smooth flow. There are also some language choices that may be confusing or unclear, affecting the overall fluency of the story.

Once upon a time, a certain set of people would use computers in order to help themselves do tasks that would've otherwise taken more time and effort. As computers got more and more powerful, more people began working in companies using computers for office tasks. One of the first companies with such an office was, of course, Microsoft. Microsoft was one of those guys who was always trying to figure out how they could bring computers to more markets. Sometimes they succeeded. Sometimes, not. And this was something Microsoft recognized quite early about the software it was shipping. Microsoft built Office in 1985 and it was a great attempt at making a more accessible office suite that included things like word processing, spreadsheets, and presentations. But the problem was, Office was a very limited software that required a lot of technical know-how to use and there was a lack of users who would buy it.
Consistency: 7 - The story discusses the evolution of computers and the challenges faced by Microsoft in creating an accessible office suite. While these ideas are related, the story lacks a clear direction and central focus.
Fluency: 7 - The sentences are generally well-constructed, but there are some instances where the language could be more concise and the structure more refined. The flow of the story is somewhat disrupted by the use of long sentences and repetitive phrases.

Once upon a time... I found a lot of good stuff in [the] internet, but when I was younger, I only paid attention to my mom. She was the one that was on the screen. She liked to show her boobs." At times that lack of attention led to her family turning her in to the police. "My mom was doing drugs constantly," she says. "I remember her on my brother's shoulders and [there was] a bottle on her back, and her back was twisted, like the neck muscles were in the wrong position, and there were needles all over the ground in front of her." A few months later she took her family to their local police department and claimed that her brother had killed himself in 2010. They gave her the opportunity to speak to a detective at the station. "I remember saying something like, 'I've always done drugs.
Consistency: 6 - The story jumps between the narrator's experience with the internet and their troubled relationship with their mother. While these ideas are connected through the theme of attention and family dysfunction, the transitions between them are not well-established.
Fluency: 5 - The sentences are choppy and lack a smooth flow. There are also numerous grammar and punctuation errors that affect the overall fluency of the story.

Once upon a time, people were willing to go to the woods and fight. But these days, I'd say I'm pretty low in that department. It's just you and the bears. It was just you and the bears. We had to do all this hiking to get them — the bears that attacked us. That was part of the thrill, but it was just the people and us. We were really lucky that we didn't get eaten by a bear. The wilderness itself is a big draw. I've loved wilderness climbing since I was a kid. But it was when I was in college, living in Virginia and climbing and living in the woods that I realized that I loved it there. It was this place where you had to be able to tackle anything, even if you didn't know what it was. When I got back to Denver, I started a company called Pinnacle Hiking Gear.
Consistency: 8 - The story discusses the narrator's love for wilderness climbing and their realization of this passion. The theme of adventure and personal growth is maintained throughout the story.
Fluency: 7 - The sentences are generally coherent and flow smoothly. However, there are some instances where the language could be more concise and the structure more refined. The story could benefit from clearer transitions between ideas.

Once upon a time, this was their only mode of transport; only, I remember they had to carry all their luggage in there. Oh, what a mess they made.  What a mess they made!  A week earlier, one of her parents visited. Oh, those little tykes. What a lovely surprise it was to see him.  A week before that, she attended a birthday party at a nearby convent. Now that, isn't so cute! I really didn't think much of her parents.  She was also quite shocked to see her sister in the guest house last year. Not so much for the birthday present, but because of a secret affair this very young girl was in with a fellow student - that girl even had her name written all over her!  Oh, what a surprise!  After school that day, her sister and the boy that was her boyfriend went inside her house.
Consistency: 5 - The story jumps between various events and descriptions, such as transportation, family visits, birthday parties, and secret affairs. The connection between these elements is not clear, resulting in an inconsistent narrative.

Once upon a time, there was a country called the United States. Not the United States of America, of course, but the United States of America. Now this story took a weird turn, and all the people on the planet were so worried about it that they sent a space probe to the moon to help them out. I'm talking, of course, about Apollo 11. Before I talk about the Apollo 11 rocket being dropped in lunar orbit, let me back up and provide a bit of history on how a moon landing could happen. In February 1958, a former colonel with a lot of experience in military affairs, Admiral James Webb, made a presentation to the United States Congress. This was not about going to the moon - it was about what he proposed as the best course of action after the USSR was up and about with the successful test flight of Sputnik.
Consistency: 7 - The story discusses the United States, the Apollo 11 mission, and the history behind it. While these ideas are related, there is a slight lack of cohesion between them, causing a minor inconsistency.

Once upon a time, it was easy to spot these men and their work around Washington. And like many of the work that goes on in the capital these days, these murals and pictures of the Old Town and Jefferson Memorial — all within feet of the Supreme Court, right as the justices are finishing their daily work — are part of what's being celebrated as the "Year of the Painting." But a look at the year-old images of the Old Town and Jefferson Memorial on social media suggests not all is well. The Supreme Court is among the subjects on artworks at many of these art events. (Facebook/Year Of The Painting events) The year's inaugural Year of Painting event is held at the Supreme Court — the focal point of the event — and the artists also turned to the Lincoln Memorial, the Mall and even on foot to create scenes around the nation's capital.
Consistency: 6 - The story discusses murals, pictures, and artwork in Washington, but also mentions the Supreme Court and the Year of the Painting event. The connection between these elements is not entirely clear, resulting in a somewhat inconsistent narrative.

Once upon a time, I was a child and saw Star Wars and was absolutely obsessed—for the entire duration. And that's the magic of Star Wars. It created magic—a magic so powerful that even as a child, I was enthralled and inspired to try to recreate this magic in my own life. This magic has been shared with the world countless times, and I want everyone who loves Star Wars to experience it in the same way. And I want everyone who's ever had the experience of making music to experience it in the same way, to make music and share it at their own pace. In a sense, everything in life is a collaboration—no matter how mundane—and when creative people decide to collaborate, good things happen. And what Star Wars does—how so many films do it—is that it allows us to create and distribute music together—in a way many of us never had.
Consistency: 6 - The story discusses the availability of cheese, rare supplies in the USA, and comparisons with the rest of the world. While these ideas are related, there is a lack of clear progression or central focus, causing some inconsistency.

Once upon a time, I was a big fan of the original Halo, so I couldn't stop myself from trying to get the prequels into my collection. But by the mid-2000s, I'd grown out of that. I just wasn't that into them. I've also been through a few years of gaming and am now more than willing to let these games go, and my husband would get pretty worked up about it. So we picked up one of the original Halo: Combat Evolved for my Xbox and immediately the thing just… broke. Now, we're both game collectors, so I know how games break and we're still playing Halo: Combat Evolved to this day. But the fact that Halo: Combat Evolved just… didn't… work… well, that really pissed him off. And as much as he hates them, I was getting mad at his impatience. So I started reading the FAQ and the troubleshooting. Here was what I learned.
Consistency: 5 - The story includes elements of cave exploration, the discovery of human fossils, and encounters with ancient enemies and monsters. However, the transitions between these elements are not well-established, resulting in an inconsistent narrative.

Once upon a time, you could not choose one style but rather, one style of building, regardless of the neighborhood. A brick was a brick, a stone was a stone and, as far as zoning regulations and zoning laws are concerned, the architect's stone or brick could not possibly be different. In some places, architecture was so far ahead of its times that it seemed almost a form of experimental science or art, a combination of the two. It was an amazing, though rare moment when these modernist creations seemed to break the mold while remaining beautiful both inside and out. Most recently, I have met dozens of architects in the city who still practice traditional architecture and I have never once heard them tell me that they do not respect the fact that many architectural styles have a place within their profession. Nowadays, my experience is that when one's building has a certain appearance, the first reaction of many would be that it is a "modernist" building.
Consistency: 9 - The story consistently explores the theme of architectural styles and the perception of modernist buildings. It maintains a consistent focus on the subject throughout.
Fluency: 7 - The story has some coherent sentences, but there are occasional disjointed phrases and unclear transitions between ideas. Some sentences could be rephrased for better flow.

Once upon a time, there was an idea that the universe could be represented as a three-dimensional sphere that had a large flat plane at its mid-point. It was called a geocentric (or flat) flat disk (or disk in space); by the way, geocentrism is what we now call heliocentrism. The sphere was called a flat disc because it was supposed to be flat on the inside; that is, it was supposed to be transparent and transparent on the inside. As this description illustrates, we had some ideas about what the surface of a sphere is like; the flat disk idea was completely different; it implied a spherical object which is flat on the outside. But the spherical object is flat on the inside, which is not flat at all, but rather quite flat, if one wants to talk about it. The spherical object is flat on the inside because it has a flat surface. This is a useful picture for understanding the problem.
Consistency: 7 - The story explores the concept of representing the universe as a three-dimensional sphere and a geocentric flat disk. However, there are some contradictory statements that make the overall consistency slightly lower.
Fluency: 6 - The story has some grammatical errors and confusing sentence structures that hinder its fluency. The transitions between ideas could also be smoother.

Once upon a time, we were friends, but now he's my enemy and now he's my best friend. All of a sudden, he started being against me and I felt like the best friend I'd ever had, or possibly the one I wouldn't want to lose, I started to start getting jealous." "I didn't realize just how jealous we were until I woke up the next morning and I saw the words 'best friend' on his bed, like something we'd made up on our own." The conversation then turns into a conversation about the nature of friendship, which is, to me, absolutely fantastic. Advertisement Kara has been the subject of so many questions, like: "What is your definition of friendship?" and her response: "It's someone you actually have a lot of time for." I do believe that there is such a thing.
Consistency: 6 - The story starts with the idea of friendship turning into an enemy but then transitions to a conversation about the nature of friendship. While the theme of friendship remains, the shift in focus reduces consistency.
Fluency: 5 - The story has numerous fragmented sentences and awkward phrasing that disrupt its flow. The lack of clear transitions between ideas also impacts its fluency.

Once upon a time, we were a country of people of faith who knew the truth and followed it. That time has long passed. I ask you to return to that time. In a recent column, I described how in my youth I would go to a conservative church service for the first time and be met with a smile by those attending as long as I was polite. I would ask all the right questions, and they would nod in agreement, then proceed to tell me of their problems and how they, and others like them, were being punished for being different than the rest. My question was always as follows, "Why?" "Isn't God OK?" or "Wouldn't doing what I'm supposed to do make life better?" The pastor would respond with a list of what was wrong with those who were different than himself.
Consistency: 7 - The story discusses the shift from a faithful society to a less religious one and highlights the confusion and judgment within a conservative church. However, the theme of faith becomes less prominent as the story progresses.
Fluency: 6 - The story has a few awkward sentences and unclear expressions that affect its flow. Some parts could be restructured for better coherence.

Once upon a time I played at home with my friends who were all huge fans of the game. I was able to get a couple of games in before they started playing with random people and I think it helped me out, because I couldn't even do my best and the other random guys would start taking too much damage so I could kill them easily. With the new version I see that I am now going to have to play like one of the top players and I am so excited!" How is the experience so far? I feel excited! I can't say I'm feeling like a champion, but I can't complain either. I am seeing the game being played with many more nuances than before. While I don't have all the runes yet it looks like each one of them has a different effect for different champions, so one of the more common ones would be that I can control the minion's speed instead of the base damage value.
Consistency: 8 - The story consistently discusses the experience of playing a game and the excitement of new features and challenges. It maintains a consistent focus on the subject throughout.
Fluency: 7 - The story has mostly coherent sentences but includes some fragmented phrases and awkward wording that slightly impacts its fluency. Some sentences could be rephrased for better flow.

Once upon a time, I was quite the fitness freak. I played basketball, ran, and did kettlebells. However, when my kids were young, my time for physical exertion stopped and my body began to wither. It's not unusual for people of many different ages to start and stop exercising. Many of us just don't feel able to give it the time it deserves. For me, I would be perfectly happy sitting on a beach in Hawaii every summer for a few months, just having fun while looking in the ocean. For many people, going to the gym is an important part of their daily routines. My gym membership would run me nearly $500 per year, and not including my family's healthcare contributions, that is simply not affordable to many. However, there are some things that we should never do, we should simply never make ourselves do.
Consistency: 7 - The story explores the author's experience with fitness and the challenges of maintaining physical exertion. However, it also includes unrelated thoughts about beach vacations and gym affordability, which reduces consistency.
Fluency: 6 - The story has several awkward sentence structures and unclear expressions that hinder its fluency. The transitions between ideas could be smoother for better coherence.

Once upon a time, you were forced to call the number on the front of someone's credit card to get any information about this company or its products. Well, now thanks to the internet, you can call any number on the internet. You know what's going to happen. You're going to talk crap in your normal voice and the person on the other end will tell you their real number and then they'll want you to have a conversation. And the rest of this article will be a discussion of how the internet makes that interaction easier. I think there are two main things we can call out here as important to how the internet makes it easier to chat up strangers without having to talk. The Number The first thing that happens on the internet is that you talk to someone they don't know or like and they send you on your way. That happens through email. A lot.
Consistency: 6 - The story initially discusses calling numbers on credit cards but then transitions into internet conversations. The shift in focus and lack of clear connection between ideas reduce consistency.
Fluency: 5 - The story has numerous fragmented sentences and unclear phrasing that disrupt its flow. The lack of coherent transitions also affects its fluency.

Once upon a time, I was a regular customer of a convenience store that I've since found out is actually a front for a meth lab. This store, oddly, has become my favorite place to grab cigarettes for my habit. It's an old fashioned American town, with a few local businesses tucked away in the back, such as a butcher shop, a pawn shop and a local diner. There are only about six or so people wandering through the town at any given time. The inside of the store seems a lot safer than some of the other ones I've been to in town. Most of the stores in town are either boarded up or just not worth bothering with, but this store was just fine. The shopkeep was a kindly young man named Mr. H. It turns out that the man had originally been a butcher, but eventually found a way to make a decent living while keeping food prices low by turning to the black market for his contraband.
Consistency: 7 - The story describes the author's experience with a convenience store that is a front for a meth lab. However, there is a mixture of unrelated details such as the town layout and the shopkeeper's background, which reduces consistency.
Fluency: 6 - The story has some awkward sentence structures and unclear expressions that hinder its fluency. Some parts could be restructured for better coherence.

Once upon a time, I saw one game of mine being featured with a commercial. It was a mobile game called, "Star Wars: The Force is with You." I don't recall the name of this game, but it was a game where you had to fly through a Star Wars-themed landscape, shooting things with guns. It was a game that I had programmed specifically to get me into Star Wars, something I love. I made my way through the entire app, and was happy to watch this commercial show up on my phone as I was heading to my car. To be candid, this was at the time I was finishing my game's development. The advertisement showed off some of the gameplay in the game. In it, you can't avoid a bunch of aliens. They pop out from around the screen and if you don't avoid them you get hurt. This was actually the gameplay in my game.

Fluency: 7 - The story has mostly coherent sentences but includes some fragmented phrases and repetitive words that slightly impact its fluency. Some sentences could be rephrased for better flow.

Once upon a time, I received some mail from my employer advising me that I needed to go to the local VA hospital in a short period of time or face termination. I was told that this was required by law to prevent any future problems with my medical condition. As I said, my diagnosis was not new and I had been treated by a VA physician for years. This time of year that could be a lot of work for someone and the VA was saying it had done their part of the work and was now in my best interest to go to the hospital. I was not in a position to ignore the letter and go to work without the approval of my employer or the VA. I refused to go because I knew the VA could not put me back out on the street. My employer went forward and got a "precautionary" visit from the VA to make sure I was OK. I could not believe how quickly my life was turned on its head.

Once upon a time--in the mid 2000s--Kissinger's secretary, Margaret Tutwiler, said, "Kissinger can be an asshole to you and, even though you hate him, you will still think he makes the right decisions for Israel." Maybe. At the very least, Israel never paid any price for trying to assassinate a prime minister in the 1980s. To be in the room when one of Netanyahu's closest advisers called for a pre-emptive strike on Iran's nuclear infrastructure was not the best way to make allies out of those same allies.
Consistency: 6 - The story starts with the quote from Margaret Tutwiler about Kissinger, but then transitions to Israel's actions and Netanyahu's adviser. The lack of clear connection between these elements reduces consistency.
Fluency: 5 - The story has several fragmented sentences and unclear phrasing that disrupt its flow. The lack of coherent transitions also affects its fluency.

Once upon a time I had my first love from outside of the relationship. She was, in a lot of ways, the love of my life. We had our "first date" when we were 16 and went to each other's home with my parents present. We did our best to make a relationship work. We dated for just 2 years and ended it, but it was what happened then that is haunting me to this day. The last time I dated her during that time period was during the senior years of high school. She decided to move in with her boyfriend. The reason for this move was because he had recently gotten engaged and her parents said they just wanted to give their daughter a break. She was upset at her decision and would talk about it nonstop. I was the friend and family that would accompany her on her shopping trips, I bought her a lot of things and my birthday present that year was to buy a house for her.

Once upon a time there was a woman, she was beautiful and was very popular, she traveled in the city as usual and she met a man. Now, the man was tall, well-built and handsome, and she was young and beautiful. She was also smart as a whip and was not shy of using her wiles. But her favorite thing was her wit. The man loved her dearly and tried to keep her as a friend and companion. He was always trying to help her achieve her goals, but she always managed to get as far as she had. One day this lady went to buy bread, she saw her husband preparing it and her mind was filled with thoughts of her lover. She hurriedly took out her dagger and took out the butter from the pan. After he had finished she took down the bread, the knife and placed the butter into them and said to the man with a sly look.
Consistency: 4 - The story jumps between describing the woman, her lover, and then suddenly shifts to a scene where she takes butter from a pan. The connection between these events is not clear.
Fluency: 5 - The story has some abrupt transitions and a few sentences that are not grammatically correct.

Once upon a time, that was true. But no more.
Consistency: 2 - The story abruptly states that it was once true but not anymore, without providing any context or explanation.
Fluency: 4 - The story is very short and lacks a clear structure or flow.

Once upon a time, we had a friend in Florida who was an atheist – and when we told him that we didn't think he should marry his girlfriend, he said that we couldn't be certain of that without a better test. So we asked him about a test to see if he was an atheist. He said that, yes, he was an atheist, and not in the religious sense of it. However, he noted that "I think that most of the atheist religions are the same. What I mean by the same is that they all teach the same thing – that the universe created all reality – and I think every atheist religion is basically the same – but they tell their different stories about it. So far as I can tell, the only difference between the religions of the world are how they teach themselves to look at their creator." But as you might suspect, there are atheists who don't agree with him on this.
Consistency: 7 - The story explores the concept of atheism and different perspectives on religion, but the connection between the friend in Florida and the discussion about atheist religions is not fully clear.
Fluency: 6 - The story has a coherent structure and clear sentences, but it could benefit from better transitions between ideas.

Once upon a time, I worked at a publishing house where I was told: Your idea is good enough to go to print, and the editor and the publisher will tell you exactly how to do it. When you reach the level to hire an attorney to advise you with patent and copyright issues, you can then go back to them and ask them to do something with your idea after they get an idea out of the way. Of course, that means the first thing they have to do is find out if you have a patent or copyright in your project, which is almost never the case. "I'm not an attorney. I'm just a guy on the street who read some blogs and picked up some articles. I can't talk about what's supposed to happen to your project.

Once upon a time I was a pretty hard line opponent of abortion. I believe that a woman should have the right to make her own choice, including about whether or not to have an abortion. As a devout Christian, I believe that our religious beliefs may not be the sole determinant of our personal behavior. However, as a wife and mother, I had seen firsthand the heartbreaking effects of abortion. When my late husband was taken from me, I was forced to make the difficult decision to raise our three young children while knowing I could not have a meaningful life with an unplanned pregnancy on my own. In my personal research, I had discovered that many women who abort are simply looking to escape a difficult pregnancy. Many times, they turn to abortion after their abusive husbands, or an abusive marriage, have tried to isolate and control them. This is not only physically and emotionally abusive, but emotionally and psychologically it makes women miserable in their marriages.
Consistency: 7 - The story explores the complexities of personal beliefs and experiences related to abortion, but the connection between the protagonist's personal story and the broader issues of abusive relationships and difficulties in marriages could be clearer.
Fluency: 6 - The story has some awkward phrasing and fragmented sentences, which can make it slightly challenging to follow.

Once upon a time, if an American university wanted to study one of its alumni, whether a Nobel prize winner, a Pulitzer-prize-winning journalist or a major political figure, it would turn to a list of "honorary or institutional professors" created by the university. In 2007, the National Association for Scholars, a libertarian think-tank with close links to the right wing, came up with the list of "Achilles' Heel faculty," based on academic positions that it considered "exclusively political." One of the professors is David C. Frum, who was forced to resign as an assistant secretary of state under President George W. Bush for his "extremist views" and "dangerous conspiracy theories about Iran and Israel." This was not the first time that Professor Frum has become part of the political firestorm surrounding universities.
Consistency: 8 - The story discusses the controversy surrounding a professor and his political views, maintaining a consistent theme of the intersection between academia and politics.
Fluency: 7 - The story has a clear structure and coherent sentences, but it could benefit from better transitions between ideas.

Once upon a time, he'd taken out a "laptop bank" and had the police track down his wife's whereabouts. "Laptops are very expensive," he explained. "I mean, $10,000 is a very, very large laptop. They have to weigh hundreds of pounds. One of my employees had a big 'ol laptop and she's all like, 'I can walk it around, it's a little heavy!'" Now the pair are selling the computers on Ebay for the equivalent of about $400 apiece. A "computer bank," which are essentially small computer desks that can be kept near a cash desk, are more common in London, Canada, Israel, and the US, according to a website called "Laptop Bays", which lists dozens of locations across Europe and the US. "The computer banks look like so many normal desks but the desks actually operate like banks," the website reads.
Consistency: 3 - The story jumps between discussing laptop banks, selling computers on eBay, and the concept of computer banks operating like banks. The connection between these elements is not clear.
Fluency: 5 - The story has fragmented sentences and awkward phrasing, making it difficult to follow and understand.

Once upon a time I had a girlfriend, and she told me, "We'll only have time for one date. What then?" I was only 19 and pretty much ignored her. So I did what any self-respecting 19 year old would do. I went to the mall, bought a movie, went home, watched it, told her she did a good job and then went to the mall again. The next day when she came over to discuss some business that we had discussed the day before, I got her a drink and a couple of tacos. She came back to the apartment after, but I left her there alone to cook. She finished the taco, and then looked up at me with wide eyes and said with a voice that I could not make out, "Well, I'm not going to give you a second chance to get to know me then." I sat and stared dumbly into the fire of my own hands, a blank look on my friendless face.
Consistency: 1 - The story jumps between discussing a date with a girlfriend, going to the mall, cooking tacos, and a vague mention of not getting a second chance. The connection between these events and their implications is not clear.

Once upon a time, there was a place in Canada. This is where The B-Team and Star Wars live in their prime and are celebrated in more ways with every passing day, but it is a place that many have forgotten about. That place, if you can believe it, is the city of Toronto. A city that just so happens to hold some pretty important and well known franchises that are often times misunderstood as Canada is Toronto. It would be an understatement to say that the city of Toronto holds a lot of special places in it's pockets and is often times overlooked when its in the spotlight. However, there is one place that can be described as the real Canadian mecca of pop culture. That place is the City of Toronto. To be clear, the city of Toronto does not hold any sort of cultural monopoly in Canada.
Consistency: 9 - The story consistently discusses the city of Toronto and its significance in pop culture, emphasizing its importance while acknowledging that it does not hold a cultural monopoly in Canada.
Fluency: 7 - The story flows well overall, but there are a few repetitive phrases and some sentences that could be structured more clearly.

Once upon a time, I went with my dad to the mall because he knew a discount store down there that was only open on Fridays, but he got lost, and I eventually ended up leaving. But I remember the excitement. It wasn't the lack of shopping that was depressing me — although I didn't have the money to splurge on fancy shoes or a new phone — it was the excitement of seeing other people at the mall. The way they moved their bodies, dressed in their best clothes, and walked around as though they were in a different world. All the things I felt had been done to me because I wasn't black or Latin. That was exciting, and I felt so liberated.
Consistency: 4 - The story starts with the protagonist going to the mall with their dad but then shifts to discussing race and feeling excluded. The connection between these elements is not clear.
Fluency: 6 - The story has some fragmented sentences and a lack of clear transitions, making it slightly challenging to follow.

Once upon a time, a certain team came together and tried to make it happen in the same fashion. And even though the team failed (one of these days I will find it), the idea never died.  And today, after seeing the first two trailers from Alien: Covenant, I'm excited to show you all what this team did back in the day.  The concept  All credit for the idea and concept go to Kenji Saito.  In 1977, director Sergio Leone created a short for Japanese television called "Dawn of the Dead." The concept here was for people who die in the apocalypse to be resurrected as zombies. Leone's idea of a zombie apocalypse and the zombies he created have been parodied and copied in countless movies, television shows, comics, anime and video games.  Kenji Saito's team took their zombie concept from Leone and tweaked it slightly.
Consistency: 7 - The story discusses the concept of a team working on a project and the influence of director Sergio Leone. However, the connection between the team's project and the trailer for Alien: Covenant is not fully clear.

Once upon a time, a man (or woman) would have a wife so they would not have any children of their own to raise. What they could do was just have sex with women and then pretend to be the woman. Men would put away their clothes at night, get their wives to put their clothes away, then they could hide their wives in their rooms. But then, something happened. Many men found out about the wives. Now they came home to all this nudity and were wondering if they'd be able to get away with it and not get discovered. A solution came to them; pretend that the woman was an older female relative—your Aunt or Cousin. The wives were now considered to have much greater status in the family and could, therefore, have much more freedom. Many men learned the tricks and went along for the ride.
Consistency: 3 - The story jumps between discussing men having wives, pretending to be women, and then pretending the women are older relatives. The connection and coherence between these elements is not clear.
